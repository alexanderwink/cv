I possess over 20 years of experience in the software development industry, during which I have assumed various roles and engaged in diverse development phases. I hold a particular affinity for agile, team leadership & coaching, architecture, and development. By adopting a holistic approach and recognizing the collective strength of a team, I consistently serve as a unifying force within the group. My extensive knowledge and experience enable me to identify alternative approaches to problem situations and make well-informed choices by comparing technology and methods. Additionally, I am deeply committed to understanding the context in which I operate, encompassing both the business I am involved in and the needs of end users. Consequently, the solutions I contribute to must prioritize simplicity, manageability, testability, and surpass expectations while meeting requirements.

I thrive as a team player, free from personal prestige, and consider myself an open-minded individual who embraces change and reevaluation without hesitation.
